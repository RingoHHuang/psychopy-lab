    "I want to gear today's lab towards helping you create your experiments. Today, we will learn about randomization, but also do a high-level review of the major steps in building PsychoPy experiments. I've created a memory study template for visual stimuli that you can work off of. We will review the main steps that go into each experiment. As we go through each step, if you have specific questions pertinent to your own experiment or want me to go into more detail, feel free to ask!"

If you pass the same seed to the same PRNG algorithm, you will unlock the same (psuedo)randomizated sequences. This can be an issue if you're not careful! For example, the default randomization seed for Matlab's PTB Shuffle function is the same whenever you launch a new session of Matlab.
