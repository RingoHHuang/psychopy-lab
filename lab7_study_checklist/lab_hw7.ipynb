    "### Random Assignment Example (w/ counterbalancing):\n",
    "Let's say I'm doing a memory study using three image categories: Animals, Tools, and Produce. I'm interested in the memory performance when only one category is task-relevant versus when all three categories are task-relevant (this is an **experimental condition**). For the first experimental condition, participants will press \"1\" every time an image that belongs in their target category appears (1-target condition). For the second experimental condition, participants will press \"1\" for Animals, \"2\" for Tools, and \"3\" for Produce (3-target condition). Because there are 3 categories, we need to further divide the subjects assigned to the 1-target condition into 3 **counterbalanced conditions** (for each category).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for a class of 15 people, 7 subs will go into the 3-target condition, 3 subs will go into the 1-target-animal condition, 3 subs will go into the 1-target-tool condition, and 2 subs will go into the 1-target-produce condition. (Ideally, the counterbalanced condition will have the same number of participants, but that can not always be the case). In other words, these are the bins in our hypothetical experiment with the number of subjects in each bin:\n",
    "- 3-target = 7 subs\n",
    "- 1-target, animal = 3 subs\n",
    "- 1-target, tool = 3 subs\n",
    "- 1-target, produce = 2 subs\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how I would randomly assign subjects to each condition:"
